# EDA-Analysis
IPL EDA Dataset Analysis 🏏  This repo is all about doing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the IPL dataset. I worked on  exploring different features, and creating visualizations to understand team and player performances better. 
In this analysis, I’ve looked at:

⚪ Toss decisions and how they affect match outcomes

⚪Player and team performance patterns

⚪Venue-based winning trends

⚪Overall insights from IPL history

I’ve mainly used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to handle the data and create visualizations. The goal was to find some interesting patterns and tell a story through data.
